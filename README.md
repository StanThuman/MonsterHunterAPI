Using Asp.net to build a web api to service Monster Hunter data to the web application. I aim to build an app so that people interested in playing the game can have easy/fast access to the specific item/content they're looking for. I'm and working on this project independently and for fun.

## Game Info
Monster Hunter is a game with many items..Lots of them(weapons, armor, materials, skills, craftable items, accessories, etc). The core game mechanics are built around grinding for more and more items to defeat bosses to get to the next tier of items in which the cycle just keeps repeating.
